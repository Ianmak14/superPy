Report of the final assignment of Winc Accademy named Superpy.

This assignment was pretty hard to make and understand the assignment. Combining al the learned modules/topics in one assignment was hard and took a lot of time. I had to look on the internet and other githubs for some guidance and help. Thankfully you can take a lot of information from the internet and/or other projects.

See here below the new modules with my expressions.

Argparse
Argparse, never heard of it. Had to look on the internet and youtube to find out what it was and how to use it. It is not that bad after all but some previous guidance of lessons would be pretty helpfull.

Datetime module
The datetime module was pretty handy to use and understand. I think i got some great functions.

CSV module
The csv module is a great working program when you have to work with programs like Excel and make a pdf of it. Hopefully i have to get a lot of work done with it.

PDF module
This is the other non-trivial features built in the program. Thanks to 'reportlab' and its function to convert .csv files to .pdf files, the inventory of the supermarket can be exported to a .pdf file. I think it is nice that you can automatically convert the file format and have a good looking report.

Table module
This is one of the non-trivial features built in the program. Thanks to the available documentation and the 'prettytable' module, I managed to show the results and outputs of the program in nicely looking tables.

Ending, lessons learnt.
This was a pretty hard assignment to make and put all together. I thought that i understood whole python but did not even het close when i had to make this. Thanks to the internet, youtube and winc itselff i could get a lot of information and it was pretty educational and fun to make.
